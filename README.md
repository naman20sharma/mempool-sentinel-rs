# mempool-sentinel-rs
mempool-sentinel is a Rust based Ethereum mempool observer that listens to pending transactions, groups them by account and gas price, and exposes simple metrics and alerts. It is designed as a learning friendly project that still looks like real validator tooling: clean async code, structured logging, and a small metrics or CLI interface.
